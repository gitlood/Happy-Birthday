Summary
Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building Android UI. Jetpack Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
The user interface (UI) of an app is what you see on the screen: text, images, buttons, and many other types of elements.
Composable functions are the basic building block of Compose. A composable function is a function that describes some part of your UI.
The Composable function is annotated with the @Composable annotation; this annotation informs the Compose compiler that this function is intended to convert data into UI.
The three basic standard layout elements in Compose are Column, Row and Box. They are Composable functions that take Composable content, so you can place items inside. For example, each child within a Row will be placed horizontally next to each other.
